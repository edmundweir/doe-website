                        More than 80% of Australians are worried about climate change, but donâ€™t know how to make a real impact and feel helpless to go up against the mammoth fossil fuel industry and other polluters.

                    Descendants of Earth is a mobile game that merges real world environmental action with post-apocalyptic gameplay. DoE makes it easy to take action on your own or cooperatively, and to have fun while you do it.
